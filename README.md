# Word Similarity Datasets for Thai Language

This repo will contain some translated and re-rated datasets for **word similarity for Thai language**.
Those will include WordSim-353 and others. The final versions are expected around Apr/May 2019.

## Datasets
* *tws-65*: This dataset is found in [Osathanunkul et al.](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-22000-5_56). 
    This is work by Osathanunkul, we only loaded it into a .csv file and provide it here. 
    We provide 2 versions, one with only 3 columns (the Thai word pair and the rating), 
    and a version which includes the English terms and the stddev.
